In the "dist" (distribution) folder of the Oracle APEX plugin project, you will find the packaged version of the plugin. This folder is essential as it contains the final, deployable version of the plugin. Specifically, it includes the Oracle APEX plugin file, which is a critical component. This file is designed for easy importation into an Oracle APEX environment, seamlessly integrating the plugin's functionalities into an APEX application. It's the culmination of the development process, offering a ready-to-use solution for end users.
<br/><br/>
Moving to the "src" (source) folder, this directory is the heart of the plugin's development. It's organized into three subdirectories, each dedicated to different aspects of the plugin:

- Images Folder: This subdirectory is a repository of all the visual elements used in the plugin. It typically houses various image files, which may include icons, user interface elements, background images, and any other graphics integral to the plugin's design. These images are crucial for enhancing the visual appeal and user experience of the plugin.

- jQuery Folder: This section of the source directory is focused on JavaScript, particularly emphasizing jQuery, a widely-used JavaScript library. The jQuery folder generally contains custom scripts written in JavaScript, leveraging the jQuery framework to provide dynamic and interactive features in the plugin. These scripts are often key to making the user interface responsive and intuitive.

- SQL Folder: The SQL folder is all about database interaction. It usually contains various SQL scripts necessary for the plugin's operation. These might include scripts for setting up database tables, creating views, defining stored procedures, and other essential database operations. The SQL folder is critical for ensuring that the plugin can effectively communicate with and manipulate the database according to the requirements of the application.

Overall, this structure reflects a comprehensive and methodologically sound approach to plugin development for Oracle APEX. It demonstrates a clear separation of concerns and organized file management, which are crucial for efficient development and future maintenance of the plugin.
